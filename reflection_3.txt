This is the last reflection
Congratulations

The question for this reflection is :

Q1: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: I think it's because sometimes maybe i don't wanna pull that change into my
local repository


Q2: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: Github -> Github == forks

   Github -> Local  == clones
   
   Local -> Local   == branches; Github -> Github == branches
