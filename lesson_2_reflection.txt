this is the lesson_2.
1. I have learned how to init a repository in git
	
   Next, it'll be how to upload the file to github using terminal
2. Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

   By using command: git log --graph --oneline 
   or              : git log --graph --oneline branch1 branch2

   I can see the commit structure very clearly.
